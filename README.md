# SVD-Image-Compression
Utilizing singular value decomposition to alter an image's compression


if ```A``` is an ```m × n``` real matrix with ```m > n```, then ```A``` can be rewritten by singular value decomposition of form ```A = U∑Vᵀ```, where the columns of ```U``` and ```Vᵀ``` are orthonormal and ```∑``` a diagonal matrix with positive real entries.

I utilized core linear algebra concepts such as norm(Frobenius), single value decomposition, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, linear transformation theory, and more, and combined it with the expansive, and frankly wonderful, mathematical functionality of MATLAB.
