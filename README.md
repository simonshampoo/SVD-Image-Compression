# SVD-Image-Compression
A script utilizing singular value decomposition to alter a ```.jpg``` image's compression.

if ```A``` is an ```m × n``` real matrix with ```m > n```, then ```A``` can be rewritten by singular value decomposition of form ```A = U∑Vᵀ```, where the columns of ```U``` and ```Vᵀ``` are orthonormal (and ```U``` and ```Vᵀ``` being ```m x m``` matrices) and ```∑``` a ```n x n``` diagonal matrix with positive real entries. 

The singular value decomposition is seen vastly in many fields of science including, but not limited to: computer vision, machine learning, signal processing, least squares regression, and much more.

I utilized core linear algebra concepts such as norm(Frobenius), single value decomposition, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, linear transformation theory, and more, and combined it with the expansive, and frankly wonderful, mathematical functionality of MATLAB.
