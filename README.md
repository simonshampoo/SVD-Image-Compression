# SVD-Image-Compression
Utilizing singular value decomposition to alter an image's compression


if A is an m×n real matrix with m>n, then A can be written using a so-called singular value decomposition of the form A = U∑Vᵀ, where the columsn of U and Vᵀ are orthonormal and ∑ a diagonal matrix with positive real entries.
